# eisyforem

A while ago, a guy called jdh created a clone of Minecraft in just 48 hours using exclusively C and OpenGLâ€”a very impressive feat.  He published and documented his work online, whereupon it recieved much praise.  He continued to maintain it for a bit, but eventually, the last commit was made, on 2021-03-09.

Fast forward one year, and jdh has rapidly genericized shortly after building his way down the tech stack to creating his magnum opus of the JDH-8, and it's clear that he will not return to maintaining `minecraft-weekend`.  In addition to this disappointment, Microsoft is about to force the migration of Mojang accounts to Microsoft accounts, putting the final nail in the coffin for Minecraft as we used to know it.

With all this in mind, I have chosen to take the code from `minecraft-weekend` and use it to create a new replacement for Minecraft, with the express goals of avoiding repeating history.  This is the purpose of eisyforem.
